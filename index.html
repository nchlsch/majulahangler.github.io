					<h3>Here's a list what Steve has done for the world:</h3>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>1976</strong> - The Apple I was introduced by Steve Jobs alongside engineer Steve Wozniak. The Apple I appealed to hobbyists back in the day who had a nack for tinkering.</li>
						<li><strong>1977</strong> - The Apple II hit the jackpot for Apple with its VisiCalc software and new design. Hobbyists still enjoyed the Apple II as it still allowed expandability.</li>
						<li><strong>1984</strong> - The Macintosh was the first personal computer to integrate a mouse with a graphical user interface. It was launched with a massive media campaign with a two-minute long TV commercial.</li>
						<li><strong>1984</strong> - The Apple IIC was launched only a few months after the Macintosh with an intention to creep into midde-class households with its small form factor.</li>
						<li><strong>1986</strong> - Pixar Animation was one of Steve's love child as it truly demonstrated how art can be infused with technology. Their first blockbuster was Toy Story launched in 1995.</li>
						<li><strong>1988</strong> - NeXT launched a famous computer with an austere black cube. Steve pushed his engineers toward boundaries never ventured experimenting on various designs with hardware.</li>
						<li><strong>1998</strong> - The iMac with its candy coloured case marked the return of the revolutionary all-in-one design first introduced by the original Macintosh in 1976.</li>
						<li><strong>2000</strong> - The Power Mac G4 Cube was Apple's own version of a cubed computer. Steve continuously encouraged Jony Ive to work the cube into the Power Mac's lineup.</li>
						<li><strong>2001</strong> - The iPod was... as I am sure you have already experienced, this device truly marked a break through in usability with its industry revolutionary click wheel. Anyone would be able to use it without an instructions manual.</li>
						<li><strong>2001</strong> - Mac OS X was developed off the blueprints of the Unix-based OS developed at NeXT when NeXT was sold to Apple.</li>
						<li><strong>2001</strong> - The Apple Store took traditional retail computer sales and gave it steroids. Apple's flagship stores changed the way computer sales were done with its iconic building architecture and minimal interior design.</li>
						<li><strong>2003</strong> - The iTunes Store was Steve's vision to turn the PC into a lifestyle device enabling seemless collection of media such as movies and songs. The record industry folded when the iTunes Store arrived.</li>
						<li><strong>2006</strong> - Intel Macbooks took over the previous PowerPC processors as engineers felt that the PowerPC architecture had hit a ceiling. Sales soared as Apple laptops could finally compete with their Windows counterpart (they could even run Windows).</li>
						<li><strong>2007</strong> - iPhone debuted at MacWorld 2007 where Jobs said three things. A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a mobile phone, and a internet communications device. 'Nuff said.</li>
						<li><strong>2008</strong> - App Store, iPhone SDK came along after the iPhone took flight and developeres were able to get their apps distributed in a clean and centralised model.</li>
						<li><strong>2008</strong> - The Macbook Air was the world's thinnest notebook.</li>
						<li><strong>2010</strong> - The iPad. The large device we all wanted Apple to create but didn't know how to fit in our lives (pockets and bags). </li>
					</ul>

					<blockquote><p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
